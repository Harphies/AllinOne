## Introduction

Demonstration of the Production Ready Interception among Software System Design, ML and Sofware Engineering-- for anyone to understand and replicate when needed.

## Inspriration

Many of the greatest breakthrough in our society happens at the Interception of many disciplines which we ofter terms creativity. It comes with pain if one can learn each of the discpline and find a connection among them to build something unique and great.

Machine learning systems are never working in a standalone, they are always part of a larger system. And data needed to build powerful AI systems need to come from product Intervention to avoid overfitting

## Functionalities

- Creating Rest API with Nodejs and PostgreSQL
- Building Data Intensive Pipeline for product intervention data Pipeline.
- Consuming ML Models through RESTful API
- Building production ready ML Models Pipelines
- Scaling API Instance with Docker and Kubernetes
- Scaling ML Models with Docker and Kubernetes
